# Copilot Instructions for AI Coding Agents

## Project Overview
- This is a minimal Python project for a restaurant application.
- Source code is located in the `src/` directory. The main entry point is `src/main.py`.
- Project configuration is managed via `pyproject.toml` in the root directory.

## Architecture & Structure
- All executable code is in `src/`. There are currently no submodules or packages.

## Copilot Preferences
- Use `uv run` for running Python scripts.
- Use `uv add` to add dependencies.
- Use `uv remove` to remove dependencies.
- Reference this file for any workspace-specific instructions or preferences.
- Ask for more context and confirmation before starting processes. 

## Patterns & Conventions
- No custom patterns or advanced architecture yet; follow standard Python practices for new modules.
- If you add new features, keep them modular and place them in `src/`.
- Update `README.md` and this file with any new conventions or workflows as the project evolves.
